              Cloneverse is a lighthearted space where familiar apps meet a bit of fun and creativity. 
              Think of it as a playful twist on the platforms we all know â€” Fakebook, Notflix, and more â€” 
              reimagined for the sake of learning and a few laughs.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              This site was built as a study project to explore front-end development, design, and the joy of creating something from scratch. 
              No real accounts, no tracking, no algorithms â€” just simple code and a bit of personality.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              Everything here is made with a genuine love for learning and experimenting. The clones are just for fun, 
              and none of them are meant to replace or copy the real thing. 
              It's all about exploring how things work â€” and having some fun while weâ€™re at it.
            </p>
          
            <p>
              So whether you're just browsing, clicking through out of curiosity, or here to get inspired for your own projects â€” welcome.
              You're officially part of the Cloneverse.
